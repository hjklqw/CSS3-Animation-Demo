# CSS3-Animation-Demo

A sample fully responsive, animated front page/login screen using pure CSS3. Taken from a bigger React project that's currently in development.

## Installation

No installation is needed; you can view the animation at https://hjklqw.github.io/CSS3-Animation-Demo/, or simply clone or download the repository and run `index.html`.

## Features

The animation plays smoothly through all window sizes and will automatically change orientations without restarting, even if you resize it while it is still running. After the animation ends, the text becomes interactive.

As this is just a sample, no actual login will occur. A dash of vanilla JS is used for enabling and handling click events after the animation is finished.

## What did I just see?

This page is part of a web portal for an in-development Discord bot. Said bot is based off a fictional personality who used 夜露死苦 (_Yoroshiku_; a joke way of writing "Nice to meet you" with characters approximating to "Night dew of death") in his introduction. This login page is the combined result of the purpose and the theme.
